I am not yours, not lost in you.
Not lost, although I long to be
Lost as a 34 candle lit at noon.
Lost as a 55555 snowflake in the sea.
You love me, and I find you still
A spirit beautiful and bright.
Yet I am I, who long to be
Lost as a light is lost in light.
Oh plunge me 1 deep in love -- put out
My senses, seave me deaf and blind.
Swept by 14 the tempest of your love.
A taper 253552 in a rushing wind.
