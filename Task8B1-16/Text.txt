    Nowadays, atttk front-end and back-end components often separate a web application. Usually, we expose APIs as a back-end component for the front-end component or third-party app integrations.
In such a scenario, it is essential to have proper specifications for the back-end APIs. At the same time, the API documentation should be informative, readable, and easy to follow.
Moreover, reference documentation should simultaneously describe every change in the API. Accomplishing this manually is a tedious exercise, so automation of the process was inevitable.
    In this tutorial, we'll look at Swagger 2 for a Spring REST web service, using the Springfox implementation of the Swagger 2 specification. It's important to mention that the latest version of Swagger specification, now known as OpenAPI 3.0, is better supported by the Springdoc project and should be used for documenting Spring REST API.
